# discrete-event-simulation-salabim-unity
This project simulates a conveyor system with multiple workpiece carriers. Using Unity for 2D layout planning, it aims to answer questions about the required number of carriers. Salabim is employed for discrete event simulation to model and analyze the system's dynamic behavior. Developed as part of a university project.
